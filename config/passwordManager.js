  description: `A password manager helps you create a unique password for each online service you use. Having a unique password ensures that if one service you use is hacked, the compromised password wonâ€™t allow access to all of your other accounts.

    \n\nAt the very minimum, you should have a unique password for high-value accounts like Google, Apple, email, and banking accounts.
